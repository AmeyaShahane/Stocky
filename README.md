# StockyBlocky:
* For this project, I have used the Open Frameworks ofxBox2d library to create stock graphs based on the Quandl API.
I will also use ofSoundPlayer and ofImage for this project. 

# Rules:
* Specify the ticker of the stock under the EOD-"ticker" path located under file_reader.cpp (under Quandl API)
* Once specified, a live CSV file will be outputted based on passed API key and authentication code. 
* The live CSV recording will be vectorized and passed into closing and opening sub vectors for stock visualization.
* In moments, the appropriate stock graph will be displayed with proper position and border color scheme in console space.
* Zoom out of the console in order to get a better view of the stock graph till the point of dimensional bounds.

# Application Configuration Information:
* This application requires either Visual Studios or XCode IDE.
* Download OpenFrameworks as an extension in either Visual Studio or XCode IDE.
* Download the project or clone it from the repo.
* Generate project using OpenFrameworks extension alongside default cpp and header files in repo.
